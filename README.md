# Airbnb Price Prediction and Customer Churn Prediction Projects

## Part A: Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

### Overview
Airbnb provides a platform where property owners rent out spaces to travelers. Pricing a listing effectively is crucial for maximizing revenue while remaining competitive. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on features such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics. The analysis also provides actionable insights to help hosts optimize their pricing strategies.

### Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a regression model that predicts the price of an Airbnb listing using various listing and host features. Insights from this analysis will inform hosts about key price drivers and help Airbnb improve pricing recommendations for hosts and guests.

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Airbnb_data  

### Deliverables
- Data exploration and preprocessing: Analyze trends, handle missing values, perform data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Model development: Build a regression model to predict listing prices.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- Final report and presentation: Summarize the project and process in a video (max 5 mins).

### Success Criteria
- Regression model reaches acceptable performance metrics on test data.
- Effective communication of the key factors influencing Airbnb prices.
- Accurate predictions for new listings.

### Guidelines
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Engineer features (e.g., neighborhood popularity, amenities count, host metrics).
- Tune models and hyperparameters for optimal results.
- Present findings and results visually (charts, graphs).
- Ensure model interpretability for non-technical users.

### Tools Required
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

## Part B: Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview
Customer churn refers to customers leaving a service provider. Retaining customers is critical for business success. This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using demographic, account, and service-related data, allowing the company to take proactive retention measures.

### Problem Statement
Develop a classification model to predict customer churn using demographic and service usage data. The goal is to identify high-risk customers so the company can design effective retention strategies.

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Customer_data  
- (See "Data Information" documentation for feature details.)

### Deliverables
- Data exploration and preprocessing report or notebook: Analyze, clean, and prepare data.
- Machine learning model for churn prediction.
- Model evaluation: Assess using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- Final presentation: Up to 5-minute summary video of the entire process.

### Success Criteria
- Model output is clearly interpreted, offering actionable insights for reducing churn.
- Model provides predictions for new customer data.

### Guidelines
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Tune model hyperparameters for improved performance.
- Document all data processing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- Provide a final model balancing accuracy and interpretability.

### Tools Required
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook or suitable IDE
